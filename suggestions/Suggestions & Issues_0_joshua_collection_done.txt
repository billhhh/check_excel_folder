Changed "Apple Pie" to "Fried Apple Pie" & "Baked Apple Pie"


Changed "Curry Udon w Potato & Carrot" to "Curry Udon" because most pictures do not show any potatoes or carrots.


There are many types of Danish Pastries, so the "Danish Pastries" is very vague. Do HPB want anything specific?


Added both dry and soup based knife cut noodles


Insufficient photos of mixed fruits in cups specifically, so changed it to mixed fruits instead


Most Pesto Pasta is not plain and has garnishing e.g. tomatoes & cheese, so I changed the name to just "Pesto Pasta"


Shoyu & shio ramen look almost identical apart from shoyu's soup being slightly darker, should they be put in the same category?

Included both fried & steamed sliced fish into "Sliced fish bee hoon soup"


creamy chicken/creamy mushroom pasta/carbonara


we have a collection fish/chicken/beef burgers on their own already
