Curry pork and chicken omu rice can collaspe into one

Poke Bowl -Salmon and tuna can also collaspe into Poke Bowl, because poke ball is usually made with fish anyways and cant tell difference

Risitto one big category because cannot distinguish between different forms of risitto anyways

Is "omu" really neccesssary?

Change salted egg pork ribs to salted egg meat? Hard to distinguish
