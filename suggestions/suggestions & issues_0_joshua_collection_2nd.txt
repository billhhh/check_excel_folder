split the salads into "grain salad" & "vegetable salad" because I find it difficult to differentiate the "chicken salad" and "fish salad" as the vegetable is usually covering up the proteins therefore making the salds look almost identical.
also insufficient photos of "chicken salad" or "egg salad" alone.


fried chicken has also been compiled into one category


fried fish noodle soup without evaporated milk is almost impossible to find on any search engine it usually has milk
